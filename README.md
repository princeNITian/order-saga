# Order Processing with Saga Orchestration (AWS Serverless)

A production-inspired serverless backend demonstrating the **Saga Orchestration Pattern** using **AWS Step Functions**.

This project simulates an e-commerce order workflow where multiple distributed services collaborate to complete an order. If any service fails, AWS Step Functions automatically executes **compensation transactions** to maintain data consistency.

# Business Scenario

A customer places an order.

The system must perform the following steps:

1. Create Order
2. Reserve Inventory
3. Process Payment
4. Create Shipment
5. Notify Customer

If any step fails, previously completed steps are rolled back using compensation transactions.

---

# Saga Flow

```
Create Order
      │
      ▼
Reserve Inventory
      │
      ▼
Process Payment
      │
      ▼
Create Shipment
      │
      ▼
Notify Customer
      │
      ▼
Complete Order
```

---

# Compensation Flow

If Payment fails

```
Create Order        ✅

Reserve Inventory   ✅

Process Payment     ❌

↓

Release Inventory

↓

Cancel Order
```

---

If Shipment fails

```
Create Order        ✅

Reserve Inventory   ✅

Process Payment     ✅

Create Shipment     ❌

↓

Refund Payment

↓

Release Inventory

↓

Cancel Order
```

Compensation always executes in **reverse order**.
